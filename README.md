# mask

Create your own content elements and page templates. Easy to use, even without programming skills because of the comfortable drag and drop user interface. All content is stored in structured database tables.

## What does it do?

Mask is a TYPO3 extension for creating content elements and extending page templates. It’s possible to add new fields to any element. Fields can have several types, for example: text, file, relations, rich text, ...

## Advantages of Mask

* Mask stores the content in columns in database tables – not as XML (Flexform)

* Mask allows repeating content with IRRE technology
* Mask supports multi language projects and resolves some language bugs of TYPO3
* Mask supports workspaces and versioning
* Mask is written in Extbase, the modern way to create extensions
